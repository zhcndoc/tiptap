## Available tools

The Tiptap AI Agent extension provides a set of **built-in tools** that give your AI Agent the ability to read and edit rich text documents.

### Reading tools

The reading tools let your AI Agent read the document and understand its structure. They handle large documents efficiently while preserving the document's semantic structure.

### Editing tools

The editing tools let your AI Agent make changes to the document fast and precisely. They understand the document's structure and format, including custom elements.

### Workflow tools

The workflow tools let your AI Agent manage its work and organize itself to improve its performance on complex, multi-step tasks. They help the AI Agent plan its work, ask questions, and provide a summary of the changes it made.
